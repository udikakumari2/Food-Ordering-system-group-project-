# Food-Ordering-system-group-project-
2nd year group project
The system consist with basic two parts.We application and Mobile application.Online Food ordering system is a process in which one can order various foods and
beverages from some local restaurant and hotels using internet, just by sitting at home or any
place. And the order is delivered to the told location. Nowadays everyone is having busy schedule
whether it is urban area or rural. But talking specifically about the urban areas and deeply about
the big cities, people out there are so busy in their life that they do not get enough of time to have
their meals properly.
As these days women are no less than men, in any field. So, in big cities even wives are working
women, therefore mostly the small families manage to have their food ordered from somewhere,
as they lack time. Not only this is the case, if we talk about the children in the modern era, they
like only fast food or something from the outside. But they ignore eating homemade meals. So
food ordering system these days has one of the fastest growing market, though being a new idea.
In this project we have developed something like the same to earn from and serve the nation in a
much better way possible.
